#The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning compound interest is given on Wikipedia as
#Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of 10000 to variable P, assign to n the value 12,
# and assign to r the interest rate of 8% (0.08). Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years,
# t, that the money will be compounded for. Calculate and print the final amount after t years.

p=0
r = 0
n = 0
t = 0
result = 0

p = int(input("Enter value of principal amount"))
r = int(input("Enter value of annual normal interest rate"))
n = int(input("Enter value of nummber of times the interest is compounded per year"))
t = int(input("Enter value of number of years"))

result = (p * (1+ (r/n))**(n*t))

print (result)
